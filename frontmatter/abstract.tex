\abstract

QuickFeed is an automatic evaluation system, developed at the University of Stavanger.
Designed with the intent of easing assignment submissions, QuickFeed tests student code as they push it to a supported source control management system.
Based on the results of these tests, QuickFeed publishes feedback to students via its custom web interface.

In this thesis, we explore the possibility of further expanding how students receive feedback on their submissions, by using GitHub's pull request and issue features.
