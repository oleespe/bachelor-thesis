\section{Earlier attempt}

Adil Khurshid presents an attempt at implementing QuickFeed support for feedback via pull requests and issues \cite{adil}.
The motivation and desired result for his project very similar to this one.

Adil's approach can be summarized as follows.
To subdivide assignments into tasks, he describes teachers creating task markdown files in \textit{tests}.
From the contents of these markdown files, GitHub issues are created on all student repositories.
Furthermore, when students want to solve tasks, they create pull requests.
When an assignment deadline has passed, student and teacher reviewers are assigned to these pull requests, thereby facilitating feedback on pull requests.

A complete and finished implementation for the above approach was never accomplished, which is why the project is continued here.
